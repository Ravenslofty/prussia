//! Startup / runtime for the Sony PlayStation 2.

//! This crate provides routines to bootstrap a Rust environment for the PS2.
//!
//! Your main function needs to have the following declaration:
//! ```
//! #[no_mangle]
//! fn main() -> !;
//! ```

// Static data initialised to zero goes in the .bss segment, which is essentially a pointer to
// uninitialised memory. We need to zero .bss before the main program runs.
//
// This could be done in assembly (and is in PS2SDK), but I figured this was not speed-critical.
unsafe fn zero_bss() {
    // Due to a quirk of the linker, these symbols are given addresses, but there is no space
    // allocated for them. Instead the addresses *are* the values, in this case referring to the
    // start and end of .bss.
